## Haunted Snake (PICO-8)

>Since he was a hatchling, Snek has been plagued by these strange apparitions.

>He never understood why.

>Snek was an only child of a sick mother, who died even before he had first shed skin.

>Her last words, as he fondly remembers;

>"Seek fruit. Don't feed on other animals and the curse shall be lifted, so no other snake will ever suffer again."

>Now, as an older snakelet, Snek nears his redemption.

>Snek shall lift the curse, fulfilling his mother's last wish.

First stage is complete.
I'll continue working on it, on a slower pace I believe.
